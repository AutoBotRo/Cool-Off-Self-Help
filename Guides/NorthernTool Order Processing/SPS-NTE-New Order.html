                <p> This guide is meant to walk you through how to complete orders that come in from Northern Tool and Equipment. 

                    You will be notified by email when a new order comes in. If you have not already set up an account for email alerts - follow this guide to do so first. </p>

            </div>
            
            <h1 id="getting-to-the-order">Getting to the Order</h1>

                <p>After being notified of a new order, you will then go and log into SPS Commerce's website. Most day-to-day interactions with Northern Tool will involve you working in this system. 

                    You will be greeted with a screen that ask if you are wanting to go the fulfillment dashboard or fulfillment montior. To complete orders, you will go to the fulfillment dashboard.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/fulfillment highlighted.PNG">

                <p>You then end up at a screen where you should see all your open orders. Click on the order number to open up the order. </p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/Order highlighted.PNG">

                <p>You will be taken to the order overview. This page has all the info you will need to know about. The "ship to" addres is listed in the center of the page. You can see what they purchased near the bottom of the page. And you can see all your current to-do's on the right side of the page. </p> 

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/Order Overview Outlined.PNG">


            <h1 id="order-status">Order Status</h1>
        
                <p>To begin processing this order, you will take a look at the workflow section of the order overview. </p>
        
                <p>When looking at this section, you'll see list of steps starting with "Order Status" going all he way to "Invoice" along with emblems that tell you what is going on with this step.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>no image means the step hasn't been started</li>
                    <li><img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/In Process bubbles.PNG">This means things are in progress</li>
                    <li><img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/Saved Floppy Disk.PNG">This means you have a saved draft of a document that is waiting to be finished.</li>
                    <li><img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/sent.PNG">This means that this document has been submitted to NTE and is pending approval.</li>
                    <li><img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/completed checkmark.PNG">This means the document has been accepted and this step is complete.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This order has already been started, however - for the purposes of this guide - we will start on what normally is the first: Order Status, Acknowledgement. 

                First you will click on new </p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/order status hightlighted.PNG">

                <p>This will bring you to the document creation page. By default it will select "Quick Entry" - Make sure to change this to "Full Form Entry" and then click "Create New"</p>
        
                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/Full Form Entry.PNG" alt="">

                <p>The next thing you see should be be the document page. </p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/Document overview - order status.PNG">
            
                <p>SPS documents all look very similar, with the form portion being the only things that change. The buttons that are going to be on all docuements - which are located at the top - are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Check for Errors" highlights any missing info. This is and "Send" are going to be your most used buttons</li>
                    <li><img>"Cancel" takes you back to the main page. </li>
                    <li><img>"Save" saves a draft of the document. Each document only takes 1-2 minutes to fill out so you should hardly ever use this. </li>
                    <li><img>"Send" closes the document and sends the info to Northern Tool and Equipment </li>
                </ul>

                <p>To start filling this out, you want start by clicking on "Check for Errors". It will then highlight all the sections you need to fill out.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/check for errors highlighted - header.PNG"> 

                <p>You should see the document pages - "Header" and "Detail" both have an exclamation marks and a number. This tells you how many sections you need to fill out on each page. On the Header, you'll see "Acknowledgement Type" highlighted. You want to change to this to "Acknowledge - With Detail No Change".</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/acknowledge with no change.PNG">

                <p>Then, click on "Check for Errors" to clear this page and go to the Detail page. You can just skip this step and just click on "Detail" to go to the next page, but it tis a good habit to consistently click it to double check your work.  </p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/check for errors highlighted - detial.PNG">

                <p>You'll see "Item Status" highlighted at the bottom. You are going to want to choose "Item Accepted"(unless there is an issue as to why you can't fulfill the order) and also fill out the delivery ship date. I normally put in a date that is 2 from the current day - there is no benefit to entering anything in sooner and will only cause you headaches if NTE team starts asking questions.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/Item Acknowledgement.PNG">

                <p>Click on "Send" to complete this step and be taken to the home page.</p>

            <h1 id="notify">Notify Aimee</h1>

                <p>From the homepage, we will copy and paste the order details into an ORDER UP email to Aimee. Your email should look like this:</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/Order up email snippet.PNG">

                <p>Make sure to include the Northern Tool Order Number in the subject line as it will make searching for these orders in the future a lot easier. Once you aer done, hit send and you are done with this order until Aimee provides you a tracking number.</p>

            <h1 id="shipment">Shipment</h1>

                <p>Once you have the tracking number available, you are ready to complete the final 2 steps of this order.</p>

                <p>First, you must get your tracking number. Sometimes, Aimee is able to email the tracking to you.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/aimee email - tracking.PNG">|

                <p>So you can just open it up and copy the tracking number</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/aimee tracking.PNG">

                <p>During busy season, this may not always be possible. If that's the case, you can still get the tracking number from fedex. See how to do so here.</p>

                <p>Go to SPS, open up the order you are trying to close out, start a new document under "Shipment". Choose Full Form Entry and click Create. When you click on Check for Errors, you'll see you have 2 fields you have to fill out on the Header page.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/shipping - info.PNG">

                <p> go ahead and fill out the ship date and tracking info and move on to the Detail Page. You'll notice that there is only 1 field you need to fill out, but this is this probably the longest you'll spend on any section. Start by clicking the red plus sign.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/store customer +.PNG">

                <p> This will open up a new section, go ahead and just press the plus button and ignore every thing else.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/packet +.PNG">

                <p> This will open up another field of inputs. Here, you're going to click on Add a Line Item.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/line item +.PNG">

                <p> This the final section that we care about.  Your going to Qty per Carton to match how we sent the order. For both our portable fans, we have a 1:1 ration of qty to cartons. So for this order, I enetered 1 to match the 1 Island Breeze. Check for Erros and hit Send if everything looks good.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/qty per carton.PNG">
            
            <h1 id="invoice">Invoice</h1>

                <p>We are now at the last step to finally close out this order. As always, you're going to start a new document, choose full form entry, and cilck create. Click cehck for errors and we can get started with filling out this document.</p>

                <p>at the top of the page, you're going to enter the invoice number. This number can be anything you want it to be as it is just for our records to be able to keep track of payments for our orders. I've been using the following format: C0-####### where every order is listed sequentially. So this order has an invoice of C0-0000007 and the next one will have C0-0000008. But, feel free to use whatever you want, nobody is keeping track(except your accountant!). </p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/invoice - info.PNG">

                <p>Scroll to the bottom of the page and enter the ship date. Click check for erros and move on to the next page.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/shipping date - info.PNG">

                <p>On the Detail page, you're going to click on Add a Line Item</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/add line item.PNG">

                <p>then on the pop up page, select the items we are invoicing for. Usually it will be the whole order, however - sometimes you might want to invoice seperately. Our payment terms with Northern Tool say we can invoice them when we ship the items - no sooner. So if there is a situation where you have to ship part of the order at a later date - you can at least invoice for whatever you can send out.</p>

                <p>for this order, I will be selecting the singular island breeze that this customer ordered. Click check for erros and move on.</p>
                
                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/line item select.PNG">

                <p>on the summary page, all you have to do is enter the carrier name. for this order we used fedex. click check for errors, then click send if everything looks good.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/fedex.PNG">

            <h1 id="final">final notes</h1>

                <p>So we are all done with this order, now just to go over a couple of details.</p>

                <p>Even though you finished with an order, it will still appear on your dashboard as it is pending approval with Northern Tool.</p>

                <img src="./SPS-NTE-New Order Pictures/final dashboard.PNG">

                <p>Lastly, we are on net 31 terms with Northern Tool - so it is important to keep track of all your invoices with them as they might be paid at different times and we want to make sure we aren't missing payments from them.</p>
